# Godot XR Example
This is a minimal setup for an XR app using the Godot engine. Only the core functionality of the engine has been used. It contains a simple scene and is prepared for 2 controllers with a teleport function attached to the right controller.

## Usage
Run the app directly via SteamVR or export (remote debug) it for a standalone HMD. In the latter case make sure to setup Android SDK and check the OpenXR vendor plugin for deployment.
